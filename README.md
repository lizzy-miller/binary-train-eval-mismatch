# Binary Train-Eval Mismatch

This repository explores the difference between training-optimal and evaluation-optimal solutions in binary classification tasks.  

Specifically, it investigates how minimizing standard loss functions (like cross-entropy) can lead to suboptimal predictions when evaluated under discrete metrics like Hamming distance.
